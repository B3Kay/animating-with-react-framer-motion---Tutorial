This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
And inspired by [Scott Stolinski](https://github.com/stolinski), this is forked from his tutorial but doesn't contain any original code then the create react app. 
I fully recommend watching his youtube tutorial if you want to learn more about animating with the [Framer-Motion API](https://www.framer.com/api/motion/) because that's where I started.

Working example deployed to netlify [here!](https://exercice-generator.netlify.app/)
