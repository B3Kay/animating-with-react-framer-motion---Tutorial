# 🌈 Animating React with Framer Motion Tutorial 🚀

This project kicks off with the magic of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and a sprinkle of inspiration from the talented [Scott Stolinski](https://github.com/stolinski). 🙌 While it's a fork from his tutorial, you'll find no original code here, just the power of Create React App! 🚀

For an in-depth dive into animating with the [Framer-Motion API](https://www.framer.com/api/motion/), I highly recommend checking out Scott's YouTube tutorial—it's where my animation journey began!
